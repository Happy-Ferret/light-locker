light-locker
=================

light-locker is a simple locker (forked from gnome-screensaver) that aims to have simple, sane, secure defaults and be well integrated with the desktop while not carrying any desktop-specific dependencies.
It relies on lightdm for locking and unlocking your session via ConsoleKit/UPower or logind/systemd.


Requirements
============

To use light-locker with systemd, you need at least lightdm 1.7.0.
light-locker doesn't work with lightdm version 1.7.5-1.7.9
